## :man_technologist: { Hi there !
## :arrow_forward: [MarkdownToLaTeX](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX)
I am currently working on 
[MarkdownToLaTeX](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX), a Markdown-to-LaTeX parser you 
can [`pip -install`](https://pypi.org/project/MarkdownToLaTeX).  

The MarkdownToLaTeX parsing implements a state machine of which steps are decided by  
:pencil2: The last input character,  
:memo: A bounded memory that stores the necessary context.  

The state machine source code is [here](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX/blob/main/src/markdowntolatex/markdown/parser.py).  
Markdown parsing and LaTeX document structuring are combined 
[here](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX/blob/main/src/markdowntolatex/latex/document.py).  

MarkdownToLaTeX started as a toy project to which I could apply 
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcordier/gitcordier/main/tlaplus.png" alt="TLA Plus" width="3%">](https://github.com/tlaplus), 
as explained in 
[Specifying Systems](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book).  
The parsing state machine was first written in 
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcordier/gitcordier/main/tlaplus.png" alt="TLA Plus" width="3%">](https://github.com/tlaplus), next in 
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcordier/gitcordier/main/python-logo@2x.png" alt="Python" width="7%">](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX).  

A compiled-from-code [documentation](https://markdowntolatex.readthedocs.io) and a
[mathsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX/main/MarkdownToLaTeX_Mathsheet.pdf) are available as well.  
The first chapter of the mathsheet is about formal specification and my very own story with the topic.  
I am always eager to learn, so feel free to give me a feedback!

This is an ongoing process… :rowboat: but I try as hard as I can to keep up the pace.

## :arrow_forward: [tlaplus](https://github.com/gitcordier/tlaplus)
This repository is dedicated to TLA + specifications. Currently, you may find here the specification of a reversible hoist, invented by the Renaissance architect Brunelleschi. Relevant historical note and pictures available at http://bdml.stanford.edu/Main/BrunelleschiNotes.

## :arrow_forward: [Functional Analysis](https://github.com/gitcordier/FunctionalAnalysis) 6 :star:
Some solutions to Rudin's Functional Analysis.  
It's been a long time I haven't added new content. I really should but proofreading takes time…
Rewriting is ongoing.
## :white_check_mark: [Bellingcat](https://github.com/gitcordier/bellingcat) 9 :star:
Code from [Bellingcat's guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos).
## :white_check_mark: [The ChemicalBrowsers](https://github.com/gitcordier/TheChemicalBrowsers)
Given a chemical formula represented by a string, 
the parser counts the number of atoms of each element contained in the molecule 
then returns the result as a dictionary.  

The trick is: Reading formulas from right to left makes the algorithm pretty straightforward.
## :white_check_mark: [stack_qalculator](https://github.com/gitcordier/stack_qalculator)
Written for a job interview: A
[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. 
In other words, you can think of it as a stack-based process: First, push numbers in the stack, next compute then save the result as tail of the stack. 
## :white_check_mark: [ReversePolishNotationParser](https://github.com/gitcordier/ReversePolishNotationParser)
Another reverse polish parser, written for a previous job process. 
## :white_check_mark: [Salesman problem: Special quadratic case](https://github.com/gitcordier/minimal_length_of_graph_traversal)
The special case means quadratic complexity. I like this problem, since getting a clean algorithm was a little bit tricky, but I could make it. Found the problem in a coding contest.
## :white_check_mark: [Using Selenium](https://github.com/gitcordier/selenium)
Given a workshop (at this time, it was https://www.parisfintechforum.com), the script gets all "featured" participants websites (Source: https://www.parisfintechforum.com/PFF2018/participants).
you can see this code as a template: I assume that the code can be easily reused and applied to other websites.
