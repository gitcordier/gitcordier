## Hi there

Please find below the description of my projects and a contact section
## Current project: [MarkdownToLaTeX](https://pypi.org/project/MarkdownToLaTeX) 
I am currently working on 
[MarkdownToLaTeX](https://pypi.org/project/MarkdownToLaTeX), a Markdown-to-LaTeX parser.  

MarkdownToLaTeX started as a toy project in which I could implement TLA (Temporal Logic of Actions).  
The MarkdownToLaTeX parsing implements a state machine whose steps are decided by
1. The last input character,
2. A bounded memory that stores the necessary context.

The state machine was first written in the specification language [TLA+](https://github.com/tlaplus) then tested 
within the TLA Toolbox [TLA Toolbox](https://github.com/tlaplus). The whole sourcecode is written in Python.  

A [source code](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX) is available, 
along a compiled-from-code [documentation](https://markdowntolatex.readthedocs.io) and a
[Mathsheet](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX/blob/main/MarkdownToLaTeX_Mathsheet.pdf).  

This is an ongoing process… but I try as hard as I can to keep up the pace.
## [Functional Analysis](https://github.com/gitcordier/FunctionalAnalysis)
Some solutions to Rudin's Functional Analysis. 
It's been a long time I haven't added new content. I really should but proofreading takes time…
## [Bellingcat](https://github.com/gitcordier/bellingcat)
Code from [Bellingcat's guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos).
## [The ChemicalBrowsers](https://github.com/gitcordier/TheChemicalBrowsers)
For a given chemical formula represented by a string, parser counts the number of atoms of each element contained in the molecule and returns a dict. The trick is: Reading formulas from right to left makes the algorithm pretty straightforward.
## [stack_qalculator](https://github.com/gitcordier/stack_qalculator)
Written for a job interview: A
[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. 
In other words, you can think of it as a stack-based process: First, push numbers in the stack, next compute then save the result as tail of the stack. 
##  [ReversePolishNotationParser](https://github.com/gitcordier/ReversePolishNotationParser)
Another reverse polish parser, written for a previous job process. 
## [Salesman problem: Special quadratic case](https://github.com/gitcordier/minimal_length_of_graph_traversal)
The special case means quadratic complexity. I like this problem, since getting a clean algorithm was a little bit tricky, but I could make it. Found the problem in a coding contest.
## [Using Selenium](https://github.com/gitcordier/selenium)
Given a workshop (at this time, it was https://www.parisfintechforum.com), the script gets all "featured" participants websites (Source: https://www.parisfintechforum.com/PFF2018/participants).
you can seee the code as a template: I assume that the code can be easily reused and applied to other websites.
