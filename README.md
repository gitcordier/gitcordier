## :construction_worker: { Hi there!
## Current project: [MarkdownToLaTeX](https://pypi.org/project/MarkdownToLaTeX) :triangular_ruler:
I am currently working on 
[MarkdownToLaTeX](https://pypi.org/project/MarkdownToLaTeX), a Markdown-to-LaTeX parser.  
MarkdownToLaTeX started as a toy project in which I could implement TLA (Temporal Logic of Actions).  

The MarkdownToLaTeX parsing implements a state machine whose steps are decided by
1. The last input character,
2. A bounded memory that stores the necessary context.

The parsing automaton was first written in the specification language [TLA+](https://github.com/tlaplus) then tested 
within the TLA Toolbox [TLA Toolbox](https://github.com/tlaplus).  
The whole [source code](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX) is written in 
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitcordier/gitcordier/main/python-logo@2x.png" alt="Python" width="10%">](https://python.org)  

:books: A compiled-from-code [documentation](https://markdowntolatex.readthedocs.io) and a
[mathsheet](https://github.com/gitcordier/MarkdownToLaTeX/blob/main/MarkdownToLaTeX_Mathsheet.pdf) are available as well.

This is an ongoing process… but I try as hard as I can to keep up the pace :rowboat:
## :construction: [Functional Analysis](https://github.com/gitcordier/FunctionalAnalysis) 
Some solutions to Rudin's Functional Analysis.  
It's been a long time I haven't added new content. I really should but proofreading takes time…
## :white_check_mark: [Bellingcat](https://github.com/gitcordier/bellingcat)
Code from [Bellingcat's guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos).
## :white_check_mark: [The ChemicalBrowsers](https://github.com/gitcordier/TheChemicalBrowsers)
Given a chemical formula represented by a string, 
the parser counts the number of atoms of each element contained in the molecule 
then returns the result as a dictionary.  

The trick is: Reading formulas from right to left makes the algorithm pretty straightforward.
## :white_check_mark: [stack_qalculator](https://github.com/gitcordier/stack_qalculator)
Written for a job interview: A
[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. 
In other words, you can think of it as a stack-based process: First, push numbers in the stack, next compute then save the result as tail of the stack. 
## :white_check_mark: [ReversePolishNotationParser](https://github.com/gitcordier/ReversePolishNotationParser)
Another reverse polish parser, written for a previous job process. 
## :white_check_mark: [Salesman problem: Special quadratic case](https://github.com/gitcordier/minimal_length_of_graph_traversal)
The special case means quadratic complexity. I like this problem, since getting a clean algorithm was a little bit tricky, but I could make it. Found the problem in a coding contest.
## :white_check_mark: [Using Selenium](https://github.com/gitcordier/selenium)
Given a workshop (at this time, it was https://www.parisfintechforum.com), the script gets all "featured" participants websites (Source: https://www.parisfintechforum.com/PFF2018/participants).
you can seee the code as a template: I assume that the code can be easily reused and applied to other websites.
